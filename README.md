- 👋 Hi, I’m Mariano Perin (@marianoandresperin) from Argentina, a lawyer who dreams of becoming a Full Stack Developer, and willing to do whatever is necessary to achieve it.
- 👀 I've been passionate about technology since I was a little boy, and just recently started to begin my journey.
- 🌱 Currently learning Full Stack Development on Coder-House -an Argentina-based coding school-, looking forward to continuing nurturing my knowledge.
- 💞️ I'm slowly building a portfolio of my own, while I would love to participate in other projects.
- 📫 You can reach me on GitHub @marianoandresperin, on discord as Mariano#8414, or by e-mail to mariano.perin@gmail.com.
